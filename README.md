### Accessible music information

> Hi, Iâ€™m Ami. I am all about accessible music information to help you reach your full musical potential.

Music, however presented, should be easy to understand for the audience.
This is not always the case. For instance when using [musical notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_notation) when the audience is a classroom of young children.
In such a case, it might be more meaningful to present the music in the form of [graphic notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_notation_(music)).

And we can think of more scenarios where the above example holds true:
- A rock band, where not everyone is schooled equally in music theory.
- A group of friends, wanting to sing Christmas songs together.
- A rapper who want to spice up their backing track.

Ami is the platform which makes music information accessible.

Ami makes it possible to go from one way of presenting music into another.
Currently, we are actively working on making it possible to convert conventional sheet music (musical notation) into graphic notation. For this, we make use of the open standard [MusicXML](https://www.musicxml.com/).
In the future, we want to investigate other formats and directions of conversion.

## Projects which make up the Ami platform:
- [ami-media-processor](https://github.com/sparetimedevs/ami-media-processor)
- [ami-media-processor-function-app](https://github.com/sparetimedevs/ami-media-processor-function-app)

See the project's own README for more information about each project.
